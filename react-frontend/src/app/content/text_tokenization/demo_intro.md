## Text Tokenization:

This demo illustrates how language models convert text into tokens, the fundamental building blocks they use to understand and generate language.

As we covered in the main explanation, models don't understand words like humans do. When you see 'cat', you have a "grounded" mental image of a furry animal. The model has no grounding; it can only process statistics and numbers.

To do this, the model must first break your sentence down into manageable pieces, called tokens. These are few different methods for tokenization, but in this demo, we'll focus on word tokenization, where the model splits text into individual words.

### Here's how it works:
1. Type any text into the 'Text to Analyze' box.
2. Click the 'Tokenize Text' button.
3. The output box below will display how the model 'sees' your text, breaking it down into tokens along with their corresponding IDs. This gives you insight into the first step of how language models process and understand human language.
