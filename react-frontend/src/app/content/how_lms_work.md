How Language Models Work:
When you give a language model a prompt, it doesn’t just ‘think’ of an answer. Instead it follows a well-defined ‘generation pipeline’ to build its response one piece at a time.
This process involves two main stages. First, the model has to break down your prompt and its own working response into numbers it can understand. This is the process of generating tokens. Second, it has to algorithmically decide which tokens to bring together to create meaningful and cohering sentences, this is done by searching tokens. This section breaks down both of those steps.
