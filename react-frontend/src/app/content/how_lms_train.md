How Language Models Learn:

    How does a language model ‘learn’ to do all of this in the first place? They don’t learn like we humans do, you can’t just hand a computer the dictionary and expect it to write a beautiful poem. Language models need to be trained over a huge multistage process. These stages include the massive data stage, the supervised fine tuning, and the reinforcement learning from human feedback. After all of these steps the model goes from simply predicting text to being a truly helpful assistant.
