Planning:

This is where things get truly advanced. A language model can be used as a “planner” or a high-level controller. Imagine telling your smart home “It’s movie night” or “it’s bed time,” the model, acting as a high-level supervisor will understand the intent, and knows to call the right tools: dimming the lights or locking the doors. With recent innovations your personal AI smart-home may even be able to order popcorn for the movie!

When acting as a high-level robotic controller or “tool caller” the model is able to decide which software is needed to solve complex problems. The main benefit of using a model for this is it has a complex world model built from all of its training. Meaning that unlike a simple “if then” script the home assistant model could handle ambiguous requests with much more flexibility and in a human-like manner.
