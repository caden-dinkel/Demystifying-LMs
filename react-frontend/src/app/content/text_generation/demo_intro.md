## Text Generation: 

This demo showcases the text completion ability of a language model, it's designed to take a prompt and continue the thought. 

### Here's how it works:

1. Write a prompt in the 'Text to Analyze' box. This works great for the opening sentence of a story. 
2. Click the 'Generate Text' button.
3. The model will take your prompt as context and generate a full continuation, writing the rest of the passage in the 'Generated Output' box below.
