Supervised Fine Tuning:

    After the massive data stage, we have a model that is great at completing text, but it's not very helpful. When given a task it won't know how to properly respond. For example, it might just complete your instruction as if it were a paragraph, rather than actually following it. This is where supervised fine-tuning comes in. The general idea is to take the pretrained model and give it custom labeled datasets. For example, one of these could be a prompt asking the model to “summarize this article” with a human written response that is a high quality summary. After this stage the model is able to accurately respond to directions. However, it still doesn't provide “human-centric” responses. The model will follow any instruction, even a bad one, and doesn’t have any sense of what makes an answer good or even safe.
