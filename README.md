# Demystifying Language Models - CS598
## Project Setup Guide

Follow the instructions below to run both parts of the project.

---

## Backend Setup

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the backend folder.

2. Run the backend server:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```
Leave this terminal open to keep the backend server running.

---

## Frontend Setup

1. Open another terminal and navigate to the frontend folder.

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

The frontend should now be available at the URL shown in the terminal.
Same as before, leave this running to keep the frontend server active.

## Notes
- Run the backend and frontend in **separate terminals**.
- Ensure that the backend is running before testing frontend features that rely on it.
